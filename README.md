*Hello Hello Health Group*
I want describe more to you about my project.
In the first requirement, I implemented more 1 feature **decrement**.
I hope my UI is not bad. I don't know how to implement with beautifull UI.
In this project, I used redux-saga for manage data centralize and I think redux-saga's effect is good for handle APIs and limit some errors. I used Material-UI for UI because I'm very familar with this library and I think this library is one of the best libraries for UI.
I used: *ReactTS, Redux-saga, Material-UI (core, icons, data-grid and styles), react-router-dom, husky, eslint, prettier*.

Thank for your chance.
Please let me know your feedback.

Best regards
